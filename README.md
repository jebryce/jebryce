### Hi there 👋
- 👋 Hi, I’m John Bryce
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning
- 🌐 I'm originally from Oklahoma
- 📓 I'm a Senior in Electrical Engineering
- 🍎 I chose my major because I enjoy learning how the world works, specifically the technology we use everyday
- ✨ A fun fact about me is: I drove over the curb out of the parking lot on my driver's test (and still passed!)
- 🎓 What do I want to learn from EE 205? An understanding of what I am programming on a more fundamental level
- 📚 A book or movie I'd recommend is: 1984
